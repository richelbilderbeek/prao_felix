PRAO of Felix.

## Location

We meet at the Biomedical Center in Uppsala at the Husargatan:

At BMC, we will meet at the SciLifeLab reception at the entrance at C11:

At the SciLifeLab reception, wait in the comfy chairs,
until I pick you up and we go to my office.

## Goal

Pick one:

 * [X] Find/write an example of well-written Python code 
   that shows a run-time speed bottleneck
   at an unexpected location.
   Adapt text at https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/optimisation/runtime_speed_profiles/
 * [ ] Do the exercises at https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/optimisation/big_o/ ,
   add these to the course materials
 * [ ] Finish the Programming Formalisms example project at https://github.com/programming-formalisms/programming_formalisms_example_project
 * [ ] Convert some private notes to documentation on how to
   transfer data to Swestore

## Reflection

I think Felix was a great PRAO student.

What was great:

- Felix was great at working autonomously
- Felix felt comfortable enough to sometimes disagree
- We agreed on what needed to be done early
- Time schedule was clear

What could be improved:

- Zero of the four points were finished. This was partly by design:
  I wanted Felix to have the experience of incorrectly scheduling
  a project, i.e. I let him code the Python code first.
  I knew he should go from big to small, i.e. write the
  run-time profiling code first. 
  Maybe I should have pushed him more to do The Right Thing
- The evaluation at the end was rushed. 
  Next time, schedule 15 minutes and write this reflection together

In summary, I would recommend Felix to do a PRAO at any other place:
he did a good job!
